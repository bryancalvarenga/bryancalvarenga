## 👋 Hey, I'm Bryan

I'm a Software Engineering student and someone who enjoys understanding how things work.  
I like shaping ideas, organizing systems, and making complexity feel intentional and meaningful.

I don’t see myself as strictly **frontend** or **backend** yet — I’m exploring, learning, and figuring out where my passion fits best.  
Honestly, I appreciate both sides, and I find it beautiful when **form and logic** meet. ✨

I enjoy rock, philosophy, and poetry.  
I'm more introspective than outgoing.  
I believe in honesty, discipline, and doing what needs to be done — even when motivation is not there.

### 🌱 What I'm focusing on right now
- Strengthening my foundation in **core principles**
- Building simple but **well-thought-out** projects
- Learning to **design before coding**
- Improving clarity in how I express logic through code

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I use daily
- **Languages:** Java, PHP, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Laravel (early steps), Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Environment/IDE:** Git, PhpStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, macOS

### ⭐ About my projects on GitHub

If any of my projects interests you, I’d be genuinely happy if you:

- **Left a star** ⭐  
- **Or contributed with a PR**, if you feel like improving something 🤝

I really value **collaboration**, sharing, and learning through different perspectives.  
I learn a lot by observing how other people approach problems.
